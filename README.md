# JavaScript_Projects
These are some small projects I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Projects
- [Pizza Menu](#pizza-menu)
- [Tic Tac Toe](#tic-tac-toe)
- [Calculator](#calculator)

### Pizza Menu
I created a menu webpage that allows the user to select size and add toppings. Once the order is placed it prompts the site to display the order and a dollar total using JavaScript.

### Tic Tac Toe
I created a basic tic tac toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each selection places an image with an mp4 sound.

### Calculator
I created a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using JavaScript.
